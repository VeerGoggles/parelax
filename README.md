# Parelax
## A vision-based methodology for WebXR parelax

This experiment tracks the user's facial position relative to the screen, and offsets the screen accordingly.
Numberous methodologies and scaling values are available for experimentation, such as moving the camera vs. moving and rotating it, different smoothing functions for the scale, etc

The project has been set up to use webpack for bundling assets and code. To get started, install the project's dependencies by running the following command:
```
npm install
```

During development, you can use the following command to run a `webpack server` for testing on your computer or a device on your local network:
```
npm run start
```

And when you're ready to publish your site, run the following command. The resulting `dist` folder can be uploaded to ZapWorks for publishing. If you'd like to self-host your site, be sure to check out the documentation on the [Zappar for React Three Fiber](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@zappar/zappar-react-three-fiber) page.
```
npm run build
```
